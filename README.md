# StoryBoard Application!


## Language Model and Data Used:

 This application uses the recently released T5 ([Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer)) model. Specifically the T5 model for this application is of size 'large' and was finetuned on the [ROCStories](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/) dataset. More specific details of how I finetuned my own T5 model are stated in the .ipynb file


## User Interface:

 - Bootstrap & JQuery were used to create the FrontEnd of the application.
 - The Drag and Drag function of reordering the input events was implemented using pure javascript
 - File Structure
